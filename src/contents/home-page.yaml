about me:
  Hi! I'm Muhammad Rizqi Ardiansyah. You can also call me Rizqi. Since I was little, I've always interested in technology and building stuff. When I was little, I really liked crafting stuff, from a simple origami to something complex like building a robot from a kit my late dad bought me.

  Then one day, when I was around ten years-old, I came across a random blog post about how to make a simple game only by writing code in Notepad. Twelve years-old me was mind-blown--the fact that you can build anything inside a computer by only writing code inside a Notepad was truly astonishing.

  Believe it or not, that moment was truly life-changing--that was the moment I found my passion in programming. That passion has sticked with me ever since.

  Fast-forward to today, I am now studying Informatics Engineering at State University of Surabaya. I also had the privilege to work as a Freelance Frontend Engineer at Rumah Coding Cerdas.

  Of course programming isn't the only thing I'm passionate about. I also like listening to music. Usually, I listen to classical music, alt-rock (especially Radiohead), electronic music, jazz, and many more!
